    pause-fullsync       Pause running fullsync replication
    resume-fullsync      Resume paused fullsync replication
    start-fullsync       Start fullsync replication

Usage: riak-repl realtime <sub-command> [<arg> ...]

  Manipulate realtime replication. Realtime replication streams
  incoming writes on the source cluster to the sink cluster(s).

  Sub-commands:
    enable      Enable realtime replication
    disable     Disable realtime replication
    start       Start realtime replication
    stop        Stop realtime replication
    cascades    Manipulate cascading realtime replication

Usage: riak-repl realtime cascades <sub-command>

  Manipulate cascading realtime replication. When this cluster is a
  sink and is receiving realtime replication, it can propagate
  incoming writes to any clusters for which it is a source and
  realtime replication is enabled.

  Sub-commands:
    enable      Enable cascading realtime replication
    disable     Disable cascading realtime replication
    show        Show the current cascading realtime replication setting

Usage: riak-repl fullsync <sub-command> [<arg> ...]

  Manipulate fullsync replication. Fullsync replication compares data
  on the source and the sink and then sends detected differences to
  the sink cluster.
   
  Sub-commands:
    enable      Enable fullsync replication
    disable     Disable fullsync replication
    start       Start fullsync replication
    stop        Stop fullsync replication
    source      Manipulate source cluster limits
    sink        Manipulate sink cluster limits

Usage: riak-repl fullsync source (max_workers_per_node | max_workers_per_cluster) [<value>]

  Set limits on the number of fullsync workers on a source cluster. If
  <value> is omitted, the current setting is displayed.

Usage: riak-repl fullsync sink max_workers_per_node [<value>]

  Set limits on the number of fullsync workers on a sink cluster. If
  <value> is omitted, the current setting is displayed.

Usage: riak-repl nat-map <sub-command> [<arg> ...]

  Manipulate NAT mappings. NAT mappings allow replication connections
  to traverse firewalls between private networks on previously
  configured ports.

  Sub-commands:
    add         Add a NAT mapping
    del         Delete a NAT mapping
    show        Display the NAT mapping table

Usage: riak-repl nat-map add <external-ip>[:<port>] <internal-ip>

  Add a NAT mapping from the given external IP to the given internal
  IP. An optional external port can be supplied.

Usage: riak-repl nat-map del <external-ip>[:<port>] <internal-ip>

  Delete a NAT mapping between the given external IP and the given
  internal IP.

Usage: riak-repl proxy-get <sub-command> [ <args> ... ]

  Manipulate proxy-get functionality. Proxy-get allows sink clusters
  to actively fetch remote objects over a realtime replication
  connection. Currently, this is only used by Riak CS.

  Sub-commands:
    enable     Enable proxy-get on the source
    disable    Disable proxy-get on the source
    redirect   Manipulation proxy-get redirection

Usage: riak-repl proxy-get enable <sink-cluster-name>

  Enables proxy-get requests from <sink-cluster-name> to this source
  cluster.

Usage: riak-repl proxy-get disable <sink-cluster-name>

  Disables proxy-get requests from <sink-cluster-name> to this source
  cluster.

Usage: riak-repl proxy-get redirect <sub-command> [ <args> ... ]

  Manipulate proxy-get redirection functionality. Redirection allows
  existing proxy-get connections to be redirected to new source
  clusters so that the original source cluster can be decommissioned.

  Sub-commands:
    add          Add a proxy-get redirection
    delete       Delete an existing proxy-get redirection
    show         Show a proxy-get redirection
    cluster-id   Display the local cluster's identifier
